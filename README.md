# mcVer

**mcVer** is verification tool for smart contracts written in Solidity. Based on model checking tool VERDS, the mcVer framework is able to not only check some typical security vulnerabilities, but also verify a variety of properties of smart contracts.

## content

The project includs the dataset for the manuscript  < **mcVer: A Model Checking Based Framework for Smart Contract Verification** >. The contents contained in each folder are explained as followsï¼š

- vvmEx
  
  - In this folder, the vvm(vvmEx.vvm ) code of the example for inlustrating the composition of VML are included.
- aucEx
  
  - In this folder, the solidity source code( [aucEx.sol](https://solidity-cn.readthedocs.io/zh/develop/solidity-by-example.html) ), vvm( aucEx.vvm ) code, property definition( Property.txt ), scenario configuration( Scenario.txt ) of the running example for the manuscript are included.
- Fairness_In_Auction
  - In this folder, it includes mutipul folders, files in folder Auction_Bidders are used to test the performance of mcVer compared to [**FAIRCON**](https://github.com/ntu-SRSLab/FairCon) files in folder Auction_Efficient, Auction_Optimal, Auction_Truthful are used to check efficiency, optimal, truful property for the auction contract, respectively.
  - In each subfolder for each auction contract, the solidity source code(.sol), vvm code(.vvm), property definition( p.txt ), scenario configuration( m.txt ), counter example file(.html) are included, the time used to translate solidity to vvm is recorded in t1.txt, the time used to verify the property is recorded in t2.txt.
  - The final results for mcVer are recored in re.xlsx, the results for faircon are recorded in faircon.xlsx.
- Security
  
  - In this folder, each sub-folder is a sample to verify the corresponding security problem. In each sub-folder, the solidity source code( DoS.sol ), vvm(DoS.vvm ) code, property definition( Property.txt ), scenario configuration( m.txt ) are included.
- Access Control
  
  - In this folder, each sub-folder represents a scenario used in the manuscript. In each sub-folder,  the solidity source code( acc.sol ), vvm( SNR1.vvm ) code, property definition( Property.txt ), scenario configuration( Scenario.txt) are included.
- verds
  - In this folder, the model checking tool VERDS is included. The running environment should be Linux or CentOS.

  - It can be used to verify corresponding properties as follows( /verds/verds should be given the permission to execute ):

    ```bash
    ./verds/verds -ck 1 /runningExample/runningExample.vvm
    ```

  - Specially, for the access control contract, an additional command should be added as follows:

    ```bash
    ./verds/verds -ck 1 -OD  /runningExample/runningExample.vvm
    ```

  - When the contract does not meet the property, an execution trace will be generated by VERDS in current folder, such as  /runningExample/runningExample.cex

## Quick Start

1. **Original Solidity Code**

   Below is an example source code for the contract **aucEx.sol**

   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.4.22;
   contract Auction{
       
       address public beneficiary;
       address public highestBidder;
       uint public highestBid;
       bool ended;
   
       constructor(address _beneficiary) public {
           beneficiary = _beneficiary;
       }
       function bid() public payable{
           require(!ended);
           require(msg.value > highestBid);
           if (highestBidder!=0 ) {
               require(highestBidder.send(highestBid));
           }
           highestBidder = msg.sender;
           highestBid = msg.value;
       }
       function auctionEnd() public{
           require(!ended);
           ended = true;
           beneficiary.transfer(highestBid);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Set the scenario configuration**

   For aucEx, we set the scenario configuration to a scenario describ three bidders submit their bid at the same time, it can be described in SDL as follow:

   ```solidity
   p0:constructor(1,0,1)
   p1:bid(2,2)|p2:bid(3,3)|p3:bid(4,4)
   p4:auctionEnd(1,0)
   ```

   

3. **Set the property to be verified**

   For the scenarion defined above, the property we want to verify is the winner is who give the highest bid, it can be described in PDL as follow:

   ```solidity
   All-Runs Globally (End Imply highestBidder=4)
   ```

4. **Translate to VVM**

   After setting the scenario configuration and the property, there is a need to translate the solidity code, scenario configuration and property to VVM code according to the map from solidity to VVM.

   The VVM generated for aucEx.vvm is show below:

   ```vvm
    vvm test

   (pc_send2=4):(pc_send2=0)&(end_2=1)&(sta_2=0);
   
   ```

   

5. **Verification**

   Finally, we need to verify the vvm file using VERDS. For the aucEx.vvm, we can verify the property as follow:

   ```bash
   ./verds/verds -ck 1 /runningExample/aucEx.vvm
   ```

   The verification given by VERDS is false, and an additional excution trace will be given which is as follow:
